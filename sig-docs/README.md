# Documentation Special Interest Group 

## Background 
Documentation is the key to the success of an open source project. There will be a lot of documentation work during the operation of open source projects, and the documents written by different developers will be very different, especially the documents released to the outside world. If developers write documents and publish them directly, there will be many quality problems. Therefore, an organization is needed to polish and proofread these documents to improve the quality of the documents to a higher level. 

## Specification 
### Basic format 
reference: https://github.com/cubefs/cubefs-community/blob/master/sig-docs/doc-style-cn.md 

### Basic process 
1. Written by relevant personnel First draft. 
2. The first draft is submitted to SIG for proofreading. Each document requires two people to proofread it to prevent errors and omissions. 
3. After the first draft is proofread, the original submitter will proofread it again. 
4. Publish after proofreading. 

## Work content 
The work content of the documentation team mainly includes the following parts: 
- Proofreading of documents published on public accounts. In the future, every article published by the public account will be entered into SIG for proofreading to ensure the quality of the document. 
- Proofreading of new documents. New documents need to be proofread according to basic procedures. 
- The document has been proofread. The current documentation on the official website is of low quality and needs to be adjusted. 
- Excellent foreign language translation. You can regularly compile, translate and share excellent foreign languages. 

## Work Effectiveness 
Each document entering SIG needs to be given a corresponding schedule, and the proofreading of the document will be completed as soon as possible. If there is spare manpower in the team, each document will be completed within two days, one person per day. If the manpower is busy, a rough and specific schedule needs to be given. 

## Operation method 
SIG has a manager role, and one member rotates every month. The manager needs to complete the following responsibilities: 
- Host weekly meetings. 
- Organize meeting minutes and record meeting videos. 
- Assign tasks and track progress of related tasks. 

## Incentives 
Since the documentation work is relatively complicated, there will be relevant incentives (JD cards, community gifts) given to students who have contributed more. The specific details are being arranged. 

## Why participate in SIG 
- physical incentives and endless gifts. 
- Participate in community contributions, get to know various technical experts, and communicate with them at zero distance. 
-Improve yourself, and your writing and English skills can be greatly improved.
