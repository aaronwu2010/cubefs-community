# CubeFS CSI Special Interest Group

## Background 
k8s and CSI protocols are constantly evolving. The community's CSI still has some potential problems and many areas that need improvement, so there needs to be an organization to improve CSI-related issues and bring the community's k8s support to a higher level. 

## Improvements 
- Build related documents 
- Development related documents 
- Arm64 support 
- Functional evolution 
- Common problems sorting 
- Better use of reference documents 

## SIG Operations 
SIG has a manager role, and one member rotates every month. The manager needs to complete the following responsibilities: 
- Host regular meetings every two weeks. 
- Organize meeting minutes and record meeting videos. 
- Assign tasks and track the progress of related tasks. 
- Quarterly roadmap updates. 

At present, WeChat groups are used for timely communication, and task assignments are managed through github projects. 

## Incentives 
Since the document work is relatively complicated, there will be relevant incentives (JD cards, community gifts) given to students who contribute more. The specific details are being arranged. 

## Why participate in SIG 
- Incentives in kind, gifts are endless. 
- Participate in community contribution, meet various technical experts, and communicate with them at zero distance.
